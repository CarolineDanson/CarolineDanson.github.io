Accelerated Learning is a fast way to a new career for ambitious and driven individuals with the right skills to acquire new knowledge. The education method focuses on high-speed practical learning, agile teamwork and continuous feedback dialogue. The education includes around 500 hours of coding and is always based on specific tasks relevant to the professional role. This makes the learning process extremely efficient and therefore I can contribute as junior developer from the first day after training. During the education the focus was mainly Java, but also technologies such as object oriented programming, Spring Framework, SQL Databases, HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Scrum, Git, UX, TDD and intro to AWS."
